        <h1>UX/UI Case Study: Blackboard's Mobile App</h1>
        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>For my Senior Research Project, I decided to do a case study revolving around a mobile application that student's like myself use every single day. 
          Blackboard Learn is a web-based virtual learning environemnt and learning management system used by high schools and higher educational institutions.</p>
        <p>Because of COVID and the swap from in-person classrooms to online, Blackboard and mobile learning as a whole was used more than ever.</p>
        <p>The objective of this study is to survey the user experience of the widely used mobile application Blackboard to explore potential problems and find potential solutions and redesigns. </p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>UX/UI Designer</p>
        <p>Aug 2019 - December 2019</p>
        <h3>Qualitative Research</h3>
        <p>The most important aspect of this study was to understand who the users were and what kind of of requirements they needed to have a satisfactory experience
          Blackboard's mobile app.</p>
        <p>As a student who uses the app every day, I could get an idea of what kinds of problems or opinions other students would have.
           A survey was administered to senior students  at Eastern Connecticut State University to obtain data and responses concerning their user experience. 
           Most of them consisted of being computer science majors, while other respondents were majoring in sociology, criminology, and social work</p>
        <p>When asking respondents their reasoning for their ratings, several students said that it was simple and usable, 
          stating that they can do whatever it is they needed to do such as view assignments or announcements. 
          One respondent preferred the mobile application over the actual website, while others favored the opposite. 
          As for all the ratings below 7, many of the respondents claimed it was due to extremely slow loading times, 
          glitching, and overall lack of trust in the application in the sense of turning in assignments or taking tests/quizzes</p>
        <p>When asked about the overall design of the application, many of the respondents said that many of the pages were too cluttered and condensed,
          and that the application felt unintuitive.
        </p>

        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>The type of persona that I wanted to use when thinking about improving the application, was that of a 
          collge student who relied on Blackboard for the latest announcements for their classes and the ability to stay up to date with their homework assignments and grades
          in the most effecient and satisfactory way possible. </p>
        <p>When asked about the time spent on the application, nearly 60% of users used the application 1-3 times a day.</p>

        <h3>Goals for this project</h3>
        <p>When looking towards ways to make the application better for it's users, some of the most important aspects that I wanted to look into was:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Customizability</li>
          <li>Organization of pages</li>
          <li>Better navigation</li>
          <li>Overall clutter and overwhelming home page</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Blackboard's landing page</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
              <img src="images/bbhome.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <h2>Current landing page</h1>
              <p>When users open the application, they're introduced to a cluttered
                and overwhelming announcements page
              </p>
              <p>When students were surveyed about which features, they used the most, the top 2 features used the most were to check grades and to view homework’s/assignments. 
                Swapping from lists to cards for the courses page with the intent of being able to move around these cards to one’s preference is included to fulfills user’s 
                needs to customize the layout of their courses. </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>When users open the application, they're introduced to a cluttered
                and overwhelming announcements page
              </p>
              <p>When students were surveyed about which features they used the most, the top 2 were to check grades and to view homework’s/assignments. 
                Certain sub-sections of the courses page such as announcements and upcoming assignments are made more clear for students to identify. </p>
              <p>Originally just a list of courses, the courses tab was switched to cards which student's will have the ability to edit and move 
                for their own convenience. This certain topic was brought up by multiple respondents during the research.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <img src="images/bb2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Navigation Menu</h2>
        <p>There was also a switch from the typical hamburger menu to a bottom navigation bar, along with the announcements page being placed into a bell icon at the top left.
          This change made the application feel a lot less cluttered. The main components being:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Calendar</li>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>Profile</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Grades section</h2>
          <p>During the research, many of the respondents wanted a clear distinction between the courses and grades tab, with some preferring that they be completely separate
            sections rather than combined. 
          </p>
          <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col">
                <img src="images/bb3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>An easier way to go through each of your courses grades by adding a carousel-type function to swipe through your classes and see each grade.
                </p>
                <p>The grades page was also changed to look more clearly. One of the biggest issues some of the respondents had been that the grades were not ordered by date added, but from oldest to newest. 
                  It makes it difficult and causes a nuisance for users having to look for a huge list of grades. Making the latest assignment the first item in the list solves that.  </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>When a final presentation was given talking about my research, many of the respondents had a positive reaction towards my ideas on solving current design and feature problems with 
            the application. As a student who always used this application, this topic was relevant and important to me as well.</p>
          <p>This was my first time ever doing research or case study concerning the user experience of a mobile application. Doing this case study helped me better understand
            how different levels of UX and UI design can impact a user's experience with a mobile app and the importance of maintaing a satisfactory and positive experience.</p>

          <p>Although not every single aspect of the application was looked over as this was a school project and was restricted due to time, I would eventually like to incorporate
            more designs and implement more intuitive features that could improve this application. </p>
